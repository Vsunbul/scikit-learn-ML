    "You are given a dataset that consists of percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index over 1,250 days, from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2005. For each date, we have recorded the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, Lag1 through Lag5. We have also recorded Volume (the number of shares traded) Today (the percentage return on the date in question) and Direction (whether the market was Up or Down on this date). Try different classification models in order to predict Direction using Lag1 through Lag5 and Volume (do not use today as it is the outcome). Carry all necessary validation and test steps. Evaluate and comment about your performance. \n",
